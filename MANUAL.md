To set up MySQL on Linux, first download and install MySQL by following the official installation guide at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/linux-installation.html. Once installed, run the command sudo mysql_secure_installation -y in your terminal to secure the installation. When prompted, select 0 for a low-level password and create a passwordâ€”you can use the same password configured in the database_creator.py file for consistency with the project setup. After MySQL is configured, execute the database_creator.py script to generate the database and tables. If errors occur, first comment out the tables section and run only the database creation portion, then uncomment the tables section and rerun the script. This will leave you with an empty database structure, which will be populated later using a separate seeding script.

For the React frontend, ensure React is installed on your system. Open a separate terminal from the Django server, navigate to the frontend directory, and run npm install to install dependencies if this is your first setup. Once dependencies are installed, start the React development server by running npm run dev while the Django server is active. The frontend will then be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000. If issues arise, verify that the MySQL password matches the one in database_creator.py and that the MySQL service is running. For React errors, confirm that dependencies were installed correctly and that the Django backend is running before launching the frontend.
